Based on the current criteria for the mentorship program, birth dates between Jan 1 and Dec 31 1965, there are 1,549 employees eligible to participate. When breaking down the eligible candidates by current job title it is clear that there will be more than enough retiring employees act as mentors.

The problem that Pewlett Hackard will face is that the mentorship program will only potentially fill 1.71% of the retiring postions. This means that the comapny will still need to engage in an agressive hiring program for mid and senior level staff inthe near future to ensure that there are no business impacts from the upcoming retirements.
